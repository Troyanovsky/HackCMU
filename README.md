# HackCMU
This is for a projct made by Guodong Zhao, Sihao Yu, Lingyu Liu, Tianyang Feng for HackCMU Fall 2016. 

Taking coding course such as 15112 in university might be a challenging experience. Yet most coding games are too far away for students' daily life and thus feels unrealistic. We aim to make a coding game that help student understand basic ideas of Python programming in real life scenario. Thus we produced this game to lead students into world of Python.
